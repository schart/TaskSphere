(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about

project and task management platform built with a clean, secure, and modular NestJS architecture.It allows each user to manage their own project and organize tasks efficiently .\n\n⚙️ Tech Stack\n\n\n\nLayer\nTechnology\n\n\n\n\nBackend Framework\nNestJS (TypeScript)\n\n\nORM / Database\nSequelize + PostgreSQL\n\n\nAuthentication\nJWT (Server-side token management)\n\n\nDocumentation\nCompodoc\n\n\nTesting\nJest (planned)\n\n\nRuntime Env\nNode.js v18+\n\n\nContainerization (optional)\nDocker\n\n\n\n\n🧱 Application Layers\n\nController → Handles HTTP routes (/project, /task)\nService → Contains business logic and data flow\nRepository → Manages database operations (Sequelize)\nEntity (Model) → Represents database tables\nGuard → Handles authentication and authorization\n\n\n🧠 Main Flow\n\nThe user registers or logs in.\nThe JWT token is managed server-side.\nA user can create only one project at a time.\nThe user can add, complete, or delete tasks within their project.\nAll routes are protected by guards (GuardJwtAuth, GuardShouldBeOwnerOfReq).\n\n\n⚖️ Business Rules (Domain Logic)\n👤 User\n\nA user cannot register twice with the same email.\nWhen a user is deleted, all their projects and tasks are removed as well.\n\n🧱 Project\n\nEach user can own only one project.\nIf a project already exists, return 409 Conflict.\nProjects can be updated or deleted only by their owner.\nDeleting a project cascades and removes related tasks.\n\n🗒️ Task\n\nEach task must belong to a project.\nTasks can be created only by the project owner.\nTask states: pending, done.\nOnly the project owner can modify or delete tasks.\n\n🔐 Security\n\nAll requests are protected by GuardJwtAuth.\nOwnership is enforced by GuardShouldBeOwnerOfReq.\nTokens are verified server-side (no localStorage usage).\n\n\n🗄️ Database Structure\nExample :User (1) ─── (1) Project (1) ─── (*) Task\n\n\nEntity\nField\nType\n\n\n\n\nUser\nid, email, password\nPK\n\n\nProject\nid, ownerId (FK→User), title, description\nPK+FK\n\n\nTask\nid, projectId (FK→Project), title, status\nPK+FK\n\n\n\n\n🧭 Future Enhancements\n\nMulti-project support (1 user → N projects)\nTeam collaboration and shared access\nTask comments and attachments\nReal-time updates via WebSockets\nAutomated testing and CI/CD integration\n\n\n🚀 Running Locally\nExample :# Install dependencies\nnpm install\n\n# Configure your environment file\n# cp .env.example .env\n\n# Start development server\nnpm run start:dev\n\nhttp://localhost:3000/\n📘 License\nMIT © 2025 Heja Arslan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching
